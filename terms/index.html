               <p>Last Updated: 12/06/2018</p>
               <p>Please read these Terms of Service (this "<u>Agreement</u>") carefully. Your use or access of the Site (as defined below) constitutes your consent to this Agreement.</p>
               <p>This Agreement is between you and Radar Relay, Inc. ("<u>Company</u>" or "<u>we</u>" or "<u>us</u>") concerning your use of (including any access to) Company’s website, currently located at radarrelay.com, mobile applications and web applications (together with any materials and services available therein, and successor website(s) or application(s) thereto, the "Site"). This Agreement hereby incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions with respect to the Site posted by Company to the Site, or otherwise made available to you by Company, including the Privacy Policy and the FAQ (each as defined below).</p>
               <p>The Company is not a financial institution and does not accept or transmit virtual currency. The Company provides a bulletin-board service for third-party traders of virtual currency. The third-party users exchange virtual currency with each other directly; the Company never takes custody of virtual currency, nor does it hold virtual currency in escrow. The settlement and execution functions essential to completion of the trade occur independently of the Relayer. The Order Book may be accessed independently of the Relayer directly through the Øx Protocol.</p>
               <p>By clicking or tapping any button or box marked "accept," "agree" or "OK" (or a similar term) in connection with this Agreement, or by accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and affirm that you are of legal age to enter into this Agreement where you live and have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement.</p>
               <p>If you are an individual accessing or using the Site on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or other entity with which you are associated (an "Organization"), then you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and such Organization, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such Organization to this Agreement. References to "you" and "your" in this Agreement will refer to both the individual using the Site and to any such Organization.</p>
               <p>This Agreement contains a mandatory arbitration provision (unless you opt-out as set forth in section 19 below) that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or any other court proceedings, or class actions or class arbitrations of any kind.</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                     <p><strong>Changes</strong>.

Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Agreement incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes.</p>
                     <p>Your clicking or tapping any button or box marked "Accept," "Agree" or "OK" (or a similar term) in connection with this Agreement, or your access or use of the Site, in each case following any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The "<em>Last Updated</em>" legend above indicates when this Agreement was last changed. We may, at any time and without liability or prior notice, modify or discontinue all or part of the Site (including access to the Site via any third-party links); charge, modify or waive any fees required to use the Site; or offer opportunities to some or all Site users. We reserve the right to introduce new features or functionality for which the payment of fees may be required.</p>

                           <p><u><em>Trading Tokens can be very risky</em></u>. Tokens are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and Transactions are generally irreversible. All Transactions are final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and participate in Transactions at your own risk.

                           <p><u><em>Understanding Tokens and Transactions may require advanced technical knowledge</em></u>. Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate the inherent risks of trading Tokens. Any reference to a type of Token on the Site does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding such type of Token, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each type of Token. We make no warranty as to the suitability of the Tokens referenced on the Site and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.</p>

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with Transactions.

                     <p><strong>Governing Law; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</strong>. This Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Site and all related matters are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of Delaware, U.S.A., without regard to its principles of conflicts of law that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction, and regardless of your location. Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, or to the extent this provision is expressly prohibited by law, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, your use of (including any access to) the Site (including all Transactions) and all related matters, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class arbitration or class action. <u>If you do not want to be bound by this arbitration provision, you may opt out</u>. In order to opt out of this arbitration provision, you must notify us in writing that you do not want to resolve disputes with us by arbitration, and such notice should be delivered by mail to Radar Relay, Inc., 340 S Lemon Ave #7998, Walnut, California, within 30 days of the earlier of (a) the date you first access or use the Site; and (b) the date you click or tap any button or box marked "accept," "agree" or "ok" (or a similar term) in connection with this Agreement. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (currently available at https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowProperty?nodeId=/UCM/ADRSTAGE2021425&revision=latestreleased), as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if applicable law allows, they can seek relief against us for you. If you opt-out of arbitration pursuant to the terms above, then the following jurisdiction and venue provision shall apply: All disputes arising out of or related to this TOS for which arbitration does not apply will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware state courts (or, if there is exclusive federal jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the State of Delaware), and the parties consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of these courts.</p>
